# notes_app
This project is a Notes App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to create and manage editable notes. The app features a clean interface with a "Create Notes" button that adds new note entries. Each note is content-editable, enabling users to type directly into the note area. A delete icon is attached to each note, allowing users to remove them. The app uses localStorage to persist notes between sessions, meaning the notes remain saved even after refreshing or closing the browser. The design is visually enhanced with gradient backgrounds, styled buttons, and intuitive icons.
